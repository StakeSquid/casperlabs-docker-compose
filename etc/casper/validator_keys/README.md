## Validator Keys  

Keys should be created by running (assuming you are in this directory for local path "."):

`sudo casper-client keygen .`

This will create `public_key_hex`, `public_key.pem`, and `secret_key.pem`. 

Note there is no difference between validator keys and account keys.  
The `keygen` subcommand can be used to create account keys. There are also
no explicit certificates to manage. Those needed are automatically generated by the system.

To provide public key for genesis, please send in the results from the following:

`cat public_key_hex; echo`

Output should be similar to this: 

`015567f6e69418cbda61e88c4168b9219c259c36e0281d70aa6eee6607c9ceeba0`

The keys will only need to be created once. These are not cleared out with uninstall of .deb or upgrading
the .deb file.

Note: the public_key_hex value has a leading `01` in addition to the hex value. This is for the `ed25519` 
algorithm used. By having a prefix byte for the hex, we can identify the algorithm for all three generated files.
